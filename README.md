Leaf Disease Classification Using CNN
Deep Learning Model for Plant Disease Detection

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify leaf diseases from images.
The notebook preprocesses the dataset, trains a CNN model, evaluates accuracy, and performs predictions on custom images.
